Course Introduction\n   We are living in the Big Data era, with virtually all innovation domains (medicine, finance, sports, physics, astronomy, etc.) becoming data-rich. Traditional database management systems (originally designed for efficient business data processing) have evolved rapidly, and new systems have emerged to support diverse data-intensive applications with specific characteristics and requirements.

These applications are often characterized by the four \"Vs\" of Big Data: Volume (data size), Variety (data formats), Velocity (e.g., streaming sources), and Veracity (uncertain data, data reliability). Their requirements may relate to data storage architecture (e.g., cloud-based), fault tolerance, or flexibility of data/computation models. This course studies advanced topics and techniques in database systems, focusing on database design & algorithms and big data processing for structured data. Traditional topics include query optimization, physical database design, transaction management, crash recovery, and parallel databases. It also surveys recent developments in areas like NoSQL databases and SQL-based big data management systems for relational (structured) data. The course reviews data processing architectures and algorithms for managing large data quantities, covering both transactional processing and data analytics.\n3.

Course Introduction\n   This course will teach a broad set of principles and tools that provide the mathematical, algorithmic and philosophical framework for tackling problems using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI and ML are highly interdisciplinary fields with impacts in applications like biology, robotics, language, economics, and computer science. AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs, while ML refers to changes in systems that perform AI-related tasks. Ethical issues in advanced AI and methods to prevent learning algorithms from acquiring morally undesirable biases are also covered.\n3.
