"""AVATAR-style (Actor–Comparator) utilities.

This package implements the offline pieces needed for AVATAR training loops:
- run collection (actor rollouts)
- evaluation/judging metrics
- sampling (positive/negative buckets)

Comparator + optimization loop can be built on top of these primitives.
